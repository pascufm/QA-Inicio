Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with Sansa and Arya Stark.\\n\\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor Rory McCann in the HBO television adaptation.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of Gregor Clegane, and was a retainer to House Lannister. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '7daa3a1123d0c01f71353319c9e4330', 'range': (1108, 1253)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3bfe802b60db7c49f07786e26a463ad8'}>,\n",

It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\\n\\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, b, d, g have become v, ð, ɣ; subsequently, p, t, k have become b, d, g in the same environment.\\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\'  in High Valyrian, but as \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\'  in Astapori.

Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\"). There is also an indefinite article, \\'\\'me\\'\\' , derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'mēre\\'\\'  (\"one\").
